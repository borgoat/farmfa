[[secret]]secret:: A TOTP is a hash generated from a secret.
This secret is usually shown as a QR code and shared between the prover and verifier.
In {product}, the prover becomes a distributed entity: recipients who share the key material,
and an oracle that actually generates the TOTP.

[[Toc]]Toc:: The "pieces" in which a TOTP secret gets split.

[[deal]]deal:: The workflow in which a dealer splits a secret in Tocs and shares them with multiple players.

[[dealer]]dealer:: Creates Tocs from a secret, and shares them with players.

[[player]]player:: During the Tocs creation phase, the individuals who each receive one of said Tocs.

[[session]]session:: Describes the workflow in which an applicant requires combining Tocs to generate a TOTP.

[[applicant]]applicant:: Initiates a session to request access to a TOTP.

[[constituent]]constituent:: The individuals who join a session to authorise an applicant to generate a TOTP, by reaching a quorum/threshold.

[[oracle]]oracle:: The entity that reconstructs Tocs into TOTP secrets, and generates one-time passwords.
Also called the _prover_, as defined in <<RFC6238>>.

[[server]]server:: In our context synonym with _oracle_.

[[TOTP]]TOTP:: As defined in <<RFC6238>>:
"an extension of the One-Time Password (OTP) algorithm [...] to support the time-based moving factor".
